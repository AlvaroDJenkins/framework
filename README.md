# Emberfuse PHP Framework (Project is still a work in progress)
Emberfuse is a simple PHP micro framework, inspired by Laravel and Slim. We are not going to compete with either frameworks but simply trying to learn from them by trying to build out their components on our own.

## Installation

It's recommended that you use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install Emberfuse.

```bash
$ composer create-project emberfuse/emberfuse blog
```

```php
<?php

// ...
```

Then create file _public/index.php_.

```php
<?php

// ...
```

## Tests
To execute the test suite, you'll need to install all development dependencies.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/emberfuse/framework
$ composer install
$ composer test
```
